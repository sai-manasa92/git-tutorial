# git-tutorial
My first Git repo. I will be updating the readme file as I learn new stuff.

## Learnings in class:
1. What is git?
2. What is github?
3. Differences between git and github?
4. What is a repo?
5. master branch
6. Branching technique.
7. Creating a branch
8. Basic writing and formatting syntax.

## Important syntax:
### Viewing all the commits:
- git log : to see the history of the commits
- press q to exit from git log
- git branch -d <branch_name> : to delete a branch locally
- git push origin —delete <branch_name> : to delete a branch remotely 

### Adding a file from local to remote:
- Creating a file locally using text editor in the folder.
- git add <file_name>
- git commit -m "Adding new file from terminal to repo"
- git push origin <branch_name>
